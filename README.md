# lobib
A linked open bibliography display system.

The plan:
Data is on Wikidata and exported in JSON.
JSON should be CSL compatible (https://citeproc-js.readthedocs.io/en/latest/csl-json/markup.html)
With the JSON file and some HTML, CSS, and JS magic a nicely formatted annotated bibliography will be listed. 
Because of CSL compatibility entries can be exported in any citation style.
