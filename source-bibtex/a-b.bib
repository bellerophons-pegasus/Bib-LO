  abstract = {In the autumn of 1953, with the support of the Archaeological Society of Athens, work I was continued in the LM II cemetery at Katsaba east of Heracleion. Test-trenches led to the finding of four tombs (T, ∆, E, Z) cut in the rock close to the other two (A, B), which in 1951 produced the alabaster amphora of Thutmose III. One of the new tombs had been robbed, but the other three yielded many finds. Of outstanding significance was Tomb Z ; it contained three bodies in wooden coffins, and a group of vases (PLATE VII), of which the most important were a bridge-spouted jug with patterns of birds and fish, a beaked jug with papyrus-flowers, and a three-handled amphora of the Palace Style with representations of the boars’-tusk helmet (PLATE VIII). A preliminary report of the excavation is given in the ‘’ 1953. The representations of the helmet are important enough to become the subject of a separate article in ANTIQUITY.},

  abstract = {The Institute of Nautical Archaeology in 1986 completed its third excavation campaign at Ulu Burun, near Kaş, Turkey. New finds include a unique gold scarab of Nefertiti that may provide confirmation for a recent theory that she served as coregent sometime during the latter years of Akhenaten's reign; a gold medallion with a nude goddess holding a gazelle in each hand, as well as other typically Canaanite gold medallions; a rock-crystal cylinder seal with gold caps, probably Kassite; an Old Babylonian hematite cylinder seal recut by an Assyrian artisan, perhaps during the Amarna period; and, in a pithos, the earliest known diptych of the type which held wax for writing surfaces. More weights, bronze tools and weapons, pottery, and copper and tin ingots also came to light, as did another faience ram's-head rhyton. At the deeper end of the site, several more stone anchors were uncovered, bringing the known total on board to 12. The site's ultimate contributions to the history of trade, international relations, and technology must await complete excavation and more positive dating. The following report is divided into three sections, on the excavations, the cylinder seals, and the gold scarab.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the latest material in many of the Mesara tholoi is later than MM.Ia, and in particular to establish that this is the case in tholos B at Platanos. It was in this tholos that Xanthoudides found the famous cylinder seal and three scarabs which have become central to any discussion of Middle Minoan chronology. In recent discussions on the chronology of the period, it has been assumed that the latest material in tholos B was of MM.Ia date, and the chronology of Middle Minoan Crete has consequently been considerably lowered I. At the Second Cretological Congress the present writer gave a verbal undertaking to present evidence to the contrary and it is this commitment which he now seeks to honour. The scope of this paper is therefore a limited one; it is not intended as an exhaustive analysis of the complete chronology of each and every tholos tomb in the Mesara.},
